### Darksky Weather App

An application that gives the user's local weather, as well as the weather anywhere around the world. The input query takes in any address type.

Before we get started, lets get a key from [Darksky](https://darksky.net/forecast/40.7127,-74.0059/us12/en) and after adding it to a dotenv file, import it and place it on line 25 in server.js

To install, you can run `npm install`, then run `npm run start`.
